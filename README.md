# Python Data Structures Practice

This repository contains Python code examples demonstrating the use of fundamental data structures: dictionaries, sets, and tuples. Each section of the code illustrates how to create, manipulate, and utilize these structures for various tasks.

## Data Structures Covered

### 1. Dictionaries
Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs. They are ordered (as of Python 3.7), mutable, and do not allow duplicate keys.

**Examples in your Python script:**
* Creating dictionaries (e.g., `student_info`, `artifact`).
* Accessing elements using keys.
* Modifying element values.
* Using dictionary methods like `.keys()`, `.values()`, and `.items()`.

### 2. Sets
Sets are unordered collections of unique items. They are mutable and useful for performing mathematical set operations.

**Examples in your Python script:**
* Creating sets (e.g., `fruits`, `set1`, `set2`, `my_fav_food`, `friends_fav_food`).
* Performing set operations:
    * `.union()`: Returns a new set containing all items from both sets.
    * `.intersection()`: Returns a new set containing only the items common to both sets.
    * `.difference()`: Returns a new set containing items from the first set that are not in the second set.
* Adding elements using `.add()`.
* Removing elements using `.remove()`.

### 3. Tuples
Tuples are ordered collections of items, similar to lists. However, tuples are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed after creation.

**Examples in your Python script:**
* Creating tuples (e.g., `city`, `latitude`, `longitude`).
* Accessing elements by index.
* Combining tuple elements to represent structured data (e.g., `friend_1`, `friend_2`, `friend_3`).

## How to Run the Code
1.  Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2.  Save your code as a Python file (e.g., `data_structures_practice.py`). Remember to replace `your_file_name.py` in the examples above with your actual file name if it differs.
3.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
4.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
5.  Run the script using the command: `python your_file_name.py` (again, replacing `your_file_name.py` with your actual file name).

The script will print the output of the various operations performed on the dictionaries, sets, and tuples.
