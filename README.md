#Python Data Structures Practice
This repository contains Python code examples demonstrating the use of fundamental data structures: dictionaries, sets, and tuples. Each section of the code illustrates how to create, manipulate, and utilize these structures for various tasks.

##Data Structures Covered

##1. Dictionaries
Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs. They are ordered (as of Python 3.7), mutable, and do not allow duplicate keys.

##Examples in your_file_name.py:

Creating dictionaries (e.g., student_info, artifact).
Accessing elements using keys.
Modifying element values.
Using dictionary methods like .keys(), .values(), and .items().

##2. Sets
Sets are unordered collections of unique items. They are mutable and useful for performing mathematical set operations.

Examples in your_file_name.py:

Creating sets (e.g., fruits, set1, set2, my_fav_food, friends_fav_food).
Performing set operations:
.union(): Returns a new set containing all items from both sets.
.intersection(): Returns a new set containing only the items common to both sets.
.difference(): Returns a new set containing items from the first set that are not in the second set.
Adding elements using .add().
Removing elements using .remove().

##3. Tuples
Tuples are ordered collections of items, similar to lists. However, tuples are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed after creation.

Examples in your_file_name.py:

Creating tuples (e.g., city, latitude, longitude).
Accessing elements by index.
Combining tuple elements to represent structured data (e.g., friend_1, friend_2, friend_3).
How to Run the Code
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Save the code as a Python file (e.g., data_structures_practice.py).
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
Run the script using the command: python data_structures_practice.py
The script will print the output of the various operations performed on the dictionaries, sets, and tuples.
